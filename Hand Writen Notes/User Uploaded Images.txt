When the user uploads something e.g, their profile picture. We have to let django know where to store it.

1. avatar = models.ImageField(null=True, default="avatar.svg")

2. run the following command
	- pip install pillow

3. Add the MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL in the settings.py 
	MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static/images'
	
	MEDIA_URL = '/images/'

4. Configure these into Project's urls.py
- import the follwoing statements
	- from django.conf import settings
	- from django.conf.urls.static import static

- append the follwoing with urlpatetrns like this:
	- urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
