Django's default UserModel will not give some some desired fields so to get rid of it, User Custom Model is created.

Steps:
1. Import the following:
	- from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

2. Create your model like this:
class User(AbstractUser):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True)
    username = models.CharField(unique=True,max_length=200)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, null=True)
    bio = models.TextField(null=True)

# You can edit these fields according to your own need

3. In your django Project settings, add this:
	- AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'base.User'   # base can be replaced with your app name

And now you are good to go, do remember to migrate these.
