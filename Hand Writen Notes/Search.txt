					--------Searching Rooms--------------------

First of all make query in views like this:

def home(request):
    query = request.GET.get('query') if request.GET.get('query') != None else ''     ....added this
    rooms = Room.objects.filter(topic__name__icontains=query)                        ....added this

"""
 What these two lines basically meaans?
 Answer is, in the first line we are making query(requesting) 
and in the second line, we are passing the this query to room and the room is searching this and will return this if found
"""
 
    topics = Topic.objects.all()

    context = {'rooms': rooms, 'topics' : topics}
    return render(request, 'base/home.html', context)

Note: With this queryset we are only able to access the room's with the topic names, 
so for accessing the rooms with different parameters, and making it look more dynamic do the following:

1. Import the following:
	- from django.db.models import Q

2. Access the 'Q' like this:
query = request.GET.get('query') if request.GET.get('query') != None else ''
    rooms = Room.objects.filter(
        Q(topic__name__icontains=query) |
        Q(name__icontains = query) |
        Q(desc__icontains = query)
                                )

Note: This pipe symbol '|' is used as or (it will be true if any of these cnditions matches) 
and you can use '&'(it is called as 'and', it will be true when all conditions matches
